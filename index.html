				<p>Jihong is a pseudo-San Diego native (born in OH but raised in CA) who celebrates her birthday on
					Thanksgiving once every 6ish years.</p>
				<h3>EDUCATION</h3>
				<p>She attended Mira Mesa High and graduated in the top 5%, despite her questionable study
					habits.<sub>1</sub> After high school, she went on to earn her bachelor's degree in sociocultural
					anthropology, a few minors, and then her master's degree in AESE<sub>2</sub> all at UC San Diego.
					While pursuing a doctorate is not currently in her plans, Jihong enjoys expanding her knowledge base
					and learning new skillsets both personally and professionally.</p>
				<h3>HOBBIES</h3>
				<p>In her free time, Jihong can often be found playing soccer. In fact, she's quite a serial sub so if
					you ever need a girl to play, hit her up! (Well, hit her up after August because she'll be too busy
					attending classes till then.) And although soccer is her primary sport, Jihong also partakes in
					other physical activities from time to time, in recreational leagues and in social
					settings.<sub>3</sub></p>
				<p>Jihong also likes organizing groups of people - from soccer teams to group projects to weekend
					parties, she has a knack for communication and pulling people together to make things
					happen.<sub>4</sub> Other talents include singing car karaoke, making boba, and braiding hair.</p>
				<h3>FOOTNOTES</h3>
				<p class="smFont">
					<sup>1</sup>In junior year AP Biology, she played Tetris on the computer through 100% of class
					lectures, yet finished the year with an A and passed the AP test (a 3 is passing!!!).<br>
					<sup>2</sup> Architecture-based Enterprise Systems Engineering aka business for engineers<br>
					<sup>3</sup>Enthusiastically endorsed by her biffle Sweeney: "in terms of other sports, Jihong can
					only be described as 'terrible' at bowling, 'mediocre' at roller blading, but sufficient at most
					running sports."<br>
					<sup>4</sup>A list of past events is available at your request. (Not really but you can still
					ask!)<br>
